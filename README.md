# Maven-Market-Retail-Analytics-PowerBI
End-to-end retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI for sales, profit, and returns analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview
1. This project involved developing a end-to-end retail analytics dashboard using **Power BI**.

2. The dashboard lets users easily filter data by time, brand, and country on their own.

3. The reports were designed so that anyone — even people without technical skills — could easily view high-level summaries (big-picture insights) and also drill down into detailed transaction-level data when needed.

*(Note: The dashboard uses example data for educational or showcase purposes, not real company data.)*

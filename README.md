# Maven-Market-Retail-Analytics-PowerBI
End-to-end retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI for sales, profit, and returns analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project involved developing a end-to-end retail analytics dashboard using **Power BI**. The dashboard provides self-service filtering for key business dimensions, including transaction periods, brands, and countries. 

The reports were designed so that anyone â€” even people without technical skills â€” could easily view high-level summaries (big-picture insights) and also drill down into detailed transaction-level data when needed.

*(Note: This dashboard is based on a simulated retail dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes.)*

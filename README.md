# Maven-Market-Retail-Analytics-PowerBI
End-to-end retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI for sales, profit, and returns analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project involved developing a comprehensive, end-to-end retail analytics dashboard using **Power BI**. The dashboard provides self-service filtering for key business dimensions, including transaction periods, brands, and countries. The goal was to structure reports that enable both summary overviews and deep-dive transaction analysis for non-technical users.

*(Note: This dashboard is based on a simulated retail dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes.)*

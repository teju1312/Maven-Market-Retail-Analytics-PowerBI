# Maven-Market-Retail-Analytics-PowerBI
End-to-end retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI for sales, profit, and returns analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview
1. This project involved developing a end-to-end retail analytics dashboard using **Power BI**.

2. The dashboard lets users easily filter data by time, brand, and country on their own.

3. The reports were designed so that anyone — even people without technical skills — could easily view high-level summaries (big-picture insights) and also drill down into detailed transaction-level data when needed.

*(Note: The dashboard uses example data for educational or showcase purposes, not real company data.)*

# ✅ Page 3: Notes

The Notes page highlights key business findings, records discovered during the project.

1. This page shows the main insights I found from the sales dashboard.

2. Each point highlights an important result, like highest sales, profit peaks, or most returned products.

3. It helps to summarize the key findings from the data in one place.

4. So instead of going through every chart, users can quickly read these notes to understand the main trends.

5. It basically acts like a summary or conclusion page of the whole project.
